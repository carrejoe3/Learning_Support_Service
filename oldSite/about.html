				This is the question I have asked myself time and time again, as I supported capable individuals with difficulties masking their true talents. As a qualified dyslexia specialist, I have helped many people with dyslexia as well as other conditions such as: dyspraxia, ADHD and depression. I started to feel helpless as an educator having to deal with the many misconceptions: "that's just the way it is" or "he/she does not have the ability to do better". Even more disturbing was hearing the endless tales from parents of their unsuccessful attempts to get the support their child needed. Often, the expectation is that parents should invest in learning by helping their child at home without suitable guidance being provided. Many parents I have encountered, feel isolated and unsure of the methods to use to help improve their child's learning and development. Additionally, it would also appear that parents are expected to be born teachers, given the years of training needed to become one. What's more, not every child has a parent who is able to help, creating significant disadvantages for some children.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Having worked with students from primary school right through to university level, the story of issues with education is still very prevalent. The time had come to think outside of the box and widen those boundaries.

			<p class="panel-body noborder panel-collapse collapse" id="collapse2">
				Then, it struck me that my helplessness stemmed from a place where I had no solution to help people who just needed guidance, understanding and support, until now. Yes, now, I have released myself from the red tape, bureaucracy and, particularly, an unwillingness to see and do things differently. This led to a simple solution being found in The Learning Support Service.

				<br/>
				Our focus is to empower individuals regardless of ability or difficulty and to develop essential skills. We have big plans consisting of software that allows individuals to learn at a pace that suits them, a range of support services which aim to embed learning and the achievement of potential through life skills development. Key subjects in life such as: literacy, numeracy and ICT will be our driving force to ensure everyone has an opportunity to improve in these areas. University students can enhance their academic skills and achievement through our range of support services. Employers as well as educators, can gain valuable insights when helping people with a learning difference whether at work or in an educational setting. Parents no longer need to feel lost as they will benefit from the specialist software designed to support their child. Additionally, specialised toolkits will allow a better understanding of their child's needs and strengths. The wealth of knowledge that we plan to make available will encompass so many elements and attempt to address those limitations I have frequently found with the education system.

				We thrive on a community spirit here at the Learning Support Service, where opinions and experiences can be shared; this is your website too. Our hope is that we will all be able to learn from each other, develop and improve on fundamental skills, in a supportive, passionate and caring environment of like minded people. I truly want every individual to feel the sense of success that you are all entitled to feel.
